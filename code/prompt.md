Prompts
Prompts examples of Nodejs , python and Java

### Node.js Prompts

```
Create a new Node.js application with a sumTwoNumbers function and Jest test cases.
```

```
Create a new Node.js application with addNumbers, subtractNumbers, multiplyNumbers, and divideNumbers functions, along with Jest test cases.
```

#### File Management System in Nodejs:
```
Develop a Nodejs application for file operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. Include functions to perform these operations on files. Write jest test cases to ensure the proper functioning of file operations.
```

#### Weather Forecast Application in Nodejs:
```
Design a Nodejs app to fetch weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI). Implement functions to retrieve current weather, weekly forecasts, and historical data based on user input. Create jest  test cases to verify the accuracy of the retrieved weather information.
```

#### User Authentication System in Nodejs:
```
Develop a Nodejs  application with user authentication functionalities such as signup, login, and logout. Utilize libraries like bcrypt or Passlib for password hashing. Implement token-based authentication and write jest test cases to ensure security and functionality.
```

#### To-Do List Manager in Nodejs:
```
Build a Nodejs app for managing a to-do list. Include functions for adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting tasks, and listing all tasks. Write jest test cases to validate the addition, deletion, and completion of tasks in the to-do list.
```

### Pyhon prompt examples
```
Create a new Python application with addNumbers, subtractNumbers, multiplyNumbers, and divideNumbers functions, along with unit test cases.
```

#### Basic Calculator in Python:
```
Create functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Implement error handling to handle division by zero scenarios. Write pytest test cases to validate the correctness of each operation.
```

#### File Management System in Python:
```
Develop a Python application for file operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. Include functions to perform these operations on files. Write pytest test cases to ensure the proper functioning of file operations.

### Java Prompts
```
Create a new Spring Boot project with a REST API for managing students.
- Use an in-memory H2 database for the students table.
- Implement the following endpoints: GET, POST, and DELETE.
- with student field id,name,age,marks
- with app name spring-boot-rest-api
